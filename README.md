# AWS Secure File Storage with IAM and CloudTrail Monitoring

## üìÅ About the Project
This project aims to create a highly secure, scalable, and monitored file storage system using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It utilizes services like Amazon S3 for storage, IAM for fine-grained access control, and CloudTrail for detailed activity logging, ensuring both data security and compliance. This architecture is suitable for businesses that need to store sensitive files securely while maintaining full visibility into data access and usage.

### üìù Key Features
- **Scalable Storage**: Use Amazon S3 for reliable, scalable, and durable object storage.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Use IAM policies to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track all file access and management activities with AWS CloudTrail.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Use Amazon SNS for instant notifications on critical events.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Use Amazon CloudWatch for real-time insights into file access patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Amazon S3** - Secure, durable, and scalable object storage.
- **AWS IAM** - Identity and Access Management for secure role-based access.
- **AWS CloudTrail** - Detailed activity logging for compliance and security auditing.
- **Amazon SNS** - Real-time notifications for critical file events.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitoring and alerting for file access patterns.
- **AWS KMS (Optional)** - Advanced data encryption with customer-managed keys.

## üìê Architecture Overview
The system architecture includes the following key components:
- **Secure File Storage (S3)**
- **Access Management (IAM)**
- **Logging and Auditing (CloudTrail)**
- **Real-Time Alerts (SNS)**
- **Data Encryption (KMS)** (Optional)

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Create S3 Bucket** - Set up a secure S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled.
2. **Configure IAM Policies** - Create IAM policies to restrict access to the bucket.
3. **Enable CloudTrail** - Set up CloudTrail to log all bucket activities.
4. **Set Up SNS** - Create an SNS topic for real-time alerts.
5. **Testing and Validation** - Perform access and security testing to validate the setup.
